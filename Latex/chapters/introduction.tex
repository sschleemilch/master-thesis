\section{Popularity of Android}
Android is an operating system by Google,
designed for mobile devices. Version 1.0 was released
in 2008 and the most recent version is 6.0 as this thesis
is written. With a remarkable market share of 82.8\%
it has grown into the most important mobile operating system
followed by Apple's iOS with 13.9\% and Microsoft's Windows
Phone with 2.6\%. See \parencite{marketshare} for a full list
of mobile operating system market shares. While the smartphone
market is still growing, Android did also attach to new
rising platforms like wearables, TV's, cars and general
embedded devices. Android is built on a Linux kernel
and because of that, Android is also open source and freely
available. Everyone is allowed to adopt it to it's own need
(except Android Wear) which is another reason for it's
rising popularity.

The daily use of smartphones and therefore Android is increasing
rapidly in nearly every scope of application. Right now the usages
are reaching from simple surfing the web to security sensitive tasks
like banking transactions, the organization of all kinds of tickets
and wireless payment methods.
One of the main factors of success are App Stores who provide simple
installable applications for nearly every imaginable task so far.  

\section{Demand of App Protection Mechanisms}
Popularity of operating systems do result in an increasing developers
interaction and app variety but attracts also 
malware and virus developers as a reason to the resulting market
size and therefore the most possible illegal profit.
Although Google has established it's own app store
``Google Play Store'' where apps are getting inspected by Google,
it's possible to install apps from so called ``unknown sources''
like websites and alternative app stores.

There are different attack vectors attackers are considering.
The main ones are packed into three following scenarios.

\subsubsection*{Scenario 1: Piracy/Intellectual Property Theft}
Something that is present in every domain where program code is being written
and can be sold is illegal copying of a whole program or copying and adapting of
its source code. Of source, not every Android app is available for free. So being
able to copy an app to another device and get it to run is a serious threat for developers. However, there do exist licensing mechanisms to check if a user is 
authorized to use the app. Another possibility for attackers would be to disassemble
the app into its source code to copy and adapt the app and releasing it by its own
(for instance with a different name and layout).
That form is crucial for apps that do contain a lot of know-how in form of written code.


%The first one is intellectual theft by extracting the source
%code of an app (which is quite simple out of the delivered
%package of an app), adapt and rerelease it with different credentials.

\subsubsection*{Scenario 2: App Patching}
Many apps these days are free of charge in their basic version and
do offer ``In-App Purchases'' for additional content or services.
An attacker could try to circumvent the licensing mechanism 
by ``patching'' the app which means injecting code at runtime or trying to get its source
code followed by adding code to bypass the licensing and reinstalling it. Of course this
leads also to a financial loss for developers. 

\subsubsection*{Scenario 3: Malicious Code Injection}
Quite similar to scenario one the attacker chooses a popular app he wants to exploit 
but this time the focus relies on getting sensitive data from users. So a good example
would be a banking app where users can also do transactions and have to enter pins and TANS. To be able to sniff sensitive data, one possibility is to get the apps source code
like in scenario one, injecting own code that implements the malicious functionality, repacking it and try to trick users into installing the app (which appears to be the
official banking app) with common social engineering techniques since this app cannot be
uploaded to an official app store if the original app is present. 


%With the same technique the attacker could also inject malicious
%arbitrary code followed by repacking and redistribution of that
%app to potential victims. Hereby, the attacker can sniff
%sensitive user data which can be exploited.

Therefore there is an urgent need of copy protection mechanisms
for Android apps which basically means in most cases to prevent reverse code engineering of the distributed application packages.
